# UFOs


**Overview**

Create a webpage that displays sightings of UFOs and in addition a table that is vibrant. The table should be able to filter by city, state, country, and shape. These filters are controlled by the input of the user.

Should any of the information entered into the text box be incorrect the table will not produce any results. Try again 
When you want to go back to main webpage, scroll up and click on UFO Sightings in the upper left hand corner of webpage.

**Summary**

Drawback one:

Larger data set that encompasses more sightings from other countries. Currently its only the US sightings on the webpage. 

Drawback two:

Second recommendation would be to provide a static drop down with search feature for all the search boxes. This would rid of the current situation where users may have a blank table because they did not input accepted text information.
